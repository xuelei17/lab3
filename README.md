This script extracts weather information from the National Weather Service. It includes more detailed information, such as humidity, wind speed, barometer, etc, based on the given location.
I encountered an error when I tried to change my input lat and lon value. It turned out that the value I used from Geolocator was different from the value used in the URL. Therefore, the script could not extract the information because it was directed to a wrong site. I fixed this problem by using the exactly same lat and lon value from the URL.
